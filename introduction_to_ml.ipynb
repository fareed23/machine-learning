    "### The three main types of Machine Learning are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised Learning: In this approach, an algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, which consists of input-output pairs. The algorithm's objective is to learn the mapping between inputs and outputs and to predict the correct output for unseen input data. Supervised learning algorithms are commonly used for tasks like image recognition, spam detection, and regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised Learning: In unsupervised learning, an algorithm is trained on an unlabeled dataset, which means there are no input-output pairs. The algorithm's objective is to find patterns, hidden structures, or relationships in the data. Unsupervised learning algorithms are commonly used for tasks like clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement Learning: In reinforcement learning, an algorithm interacts with an environment to achieve a certain goal. The algorithm learns by receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. The objective of the algorithm is to learn the best strategy, or policy, for maximizing the cumulative reward over time. Reinforcement learning algorithms are commonly used in domains like game playing, robotics, and recommendation systems."
